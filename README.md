# Improved-Identification-and-Recognition-of-Faces-using-Deep-Learning-and-Face-Mesh

This code is a comprehensive suite of unit tests for a face recognition module. The tests cover various aspects of face recognition functionality, including:

- Loading images (both standard and 32-bit images) and verifying their dimensions.
- Detecting raw face locations using both the default and CNN models, and asserting the accuracy of these detections.
- Handling partial face images and ensuring that the face locations are accurately detected.
- Batch processing of face locations, including tests for both standard and CNN models.
- Extracting raw face landmarks and verifying specific landmark positions.
- Generating face encodings and asserting the length of the encoding vectors.
- Calculating face distances to determine how similar two face encodings are, including handling of empty lists.
- Comparing faces to determine if they match a known face encoding.

Each test case utilizes the `face_recognition` API to perform operations like loading images, locating faces, extracting landmarks, generating encodings, and comparing faces. The tests use assertions to verify that the outcomes are as expected based on the input data. 

These tests are important for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the face recognition module by automatically verifying its functionality across a variety of conditions.
